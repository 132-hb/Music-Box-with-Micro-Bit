# Sensor-project using Microbit
In this project we use the Microbit and Grove sensors. When the buttons of the MicroBit are pressed, music will play with LEDS lighting up to match the beat of the song. When the volume of the buzzer is over 225, the vibration motor will start to vibrate until the voulme is lowered by tilting the MicroBit left. 
<br>The songs played on the MicroBit are the Buddy Holly riff, Among Us theme and other.

<br><b>Materials Needed:</b>
1. MicroMaker Kit
-Grove LEDS Red, Yellow and Green<br>
-Grove Buzzer<br>
-Grove Vibration Motor<br>
-Breakout Board<br>
2. Micro USB Cable
3. MicroBit
4. 9 volt Battery

<br><b>Wiring and Setup</b>
1. Put the MicroBit into the breakout board
2. Connect universal cables to the sensors
3. Connect LEDS to pins 1, 13 and 16
4. Connect Buzzer to pin 0
5. Connect Vibration Motor to pin 2

<b>To code our project, we used the Microbits MakeCode Simulation</b>
