# Sensor-project using Micro:bit
In this project we use the Micro:bit and Grove sensors. When the buttons of the Micro:bit are pressed, music will play with LEDS lighting up to match the beat of the song. When the volume of the buzzer is over 225, the vibration motor will start to vibrate until the voulme is lowered by tilting the MicroBit left. 
<br>The songs played on the Micro:bit are the Buddy Holly riff, Among Us theme and other.
